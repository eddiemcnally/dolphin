chess engine in rust

# Overview
I ran into a couple of seg faults with Kestrel that was taking a lot of time (and pain) to get sorted.

Since Kestrel was still a work-in-progress, i decided to leave it and start again in Rust.

Progress is slow as I climb the learning curve and get the hang of writing idiomatic Rust code.
